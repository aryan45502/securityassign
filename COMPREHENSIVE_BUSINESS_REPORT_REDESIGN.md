### ❌ **Previous Issue:**
The PDF business reports were showing:
- Abbreviated text like "Ø-Y¼b FRAMEVISTA" instead of proper English
- Technical placeholders instead of readable content
- Basic layout without professional analysis
- Missing comprehensive business insights
- No detailed charts or data visualization
- Unclear abbreviations and symbols
